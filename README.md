Practice Project by Demian In den Birken, Patrick Eicher, Rick Springer

Hello and welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen! You are about to witness one of the most expected data analysis of the world!

This project is based on the dataset 'International football results from 1872 to 2024' generously provided by by Mart JÃ¼risoo (Last updated Februrary 27, 2024).
You can find the dataset on kaggle via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/data (2024-03-22).

During our explorative data analysis we tried to find answers to the following questions:

1. Who is the best team of all time (by total wins)?
2. Which teams dominated the different eras of football (by total wins)?
3. What characteristics can be observed over time?
4. Can we find effects such as the 'home advantage'?
5. Were there times when there were few or no football matches?
6. Can you tell something about geopolitics from football matches - how has the number of countries changed?
7. Which countries organise the most friendly matches?
8. To what extent, if at all, does hosting a major tournament contribute to a country's chances in the tournament?

The joint results we gathered while working on this analysis were summerised in a presentation and can be replicated using the jupyter notebook and the csv-files within this Github repository.

Cheers!
